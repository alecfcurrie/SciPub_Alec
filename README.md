# Science Publications Scripts
This repo contains a collection of small Python scripts that manipulate an exported Zotero library (in CSV format)
into CSV's that can be used for data analysis and creating visualizations.

The scripts that we have are:
1. clean_data.py: cleans the Zotero import and puts it in clean_data.csv
2. authors.py: creates a list of authors and number of publications
3. tags.py: creates a list of tags and number of occurences
4. network_graph.py: creates a list of nodes and edges to create a [network graph](https://public.flourish.studio/visualisation/16796700/)
5. ubc_faculty.py: contains a list of UBC faculty, their departments, and some helpers
